<p>Providence Beat keeps you informed of the  best places to see, eat, and sleep in the biggest city in the smallest state.</p>
<h2>Rhode Island School of Design Museum of Art</h2>
<h2>This innovative and internationally renowned  museum showcases more than 80,000 works of art from Paul Revere's silver and  caricatures of 18th century Europe, to French Impressionists and the  avant-garde works of recent alumni. A 12th-century Japanese Buddha has its own  room with benches for meditating.</h2>
<h2>Benefit Street</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A mile of history is packed onto this  cobblestone street lined with historic buildings. The Nightingale-Brown House,  built in 1792, home to five generations of the Nicholas Brown Family (of Brown  University) is a &quot;must see&quot; on the block.</p>
<h2>Water Place Park and Riverwalk</h2>
<p><br>
  Watch a street artist sketching the city, enjoy  a lovely stroll by the river past Venice inspired bridges or see some wonderful  public art, all at this well-designed four-acre park and scenic riverwalk,  considered to be the heart of the restoration of Providence's downtown area. </p>
